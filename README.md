# Real-Time Batch ETL Pipeline for E-Commerce Price Drop Prediction

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

This project implements a real-time and batch ETL pipeline for monitoring and predicting product price drops in the e-commerce domain. The architecture is fully cloud-native, integrating Docker, AWS services, machine learning, and Power BI to deliver scalable and real-time business intelligence.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Docker Producer**
   - Navigate to the `docker_producer/` folder.
   - Run the producer to send live data into S3.

2. **AWS Setup**
   - Configure AWS Glue Crawlers and ETL Jobs to transform raw S3 data.
   - Query the cleaned data using Amazon Athena.

3. **Visualization**
   - Set up ODBC connection from Power BI to Athena.
   - Create real-time dashboards and KPIs.

4. **Machine Learning App**
   - Train the model (Random Forest).
   - Deploy the Streamlit app to AWS EC2.
   - Access real-time predictions via the web app.
